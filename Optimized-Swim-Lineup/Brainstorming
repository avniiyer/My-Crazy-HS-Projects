Problem: Find max number of points achievable based on leland swimmers’ best times and opposing team’s best times (focus on varsity girls lol)

Notes:
First place: 6 points
Second place: 4 points
Third place: 3 points
Fourth place: 2 points
Fifth place: 1 point

Each swimmer can only do 4 events maximum
Can’t do events back to back


How?
Start with one event at a time, our top three swimmers and their top three swimmers (we’d know which of their swimmers are entered in each event by the time this model runs)
Find the top three possible point values achievable

Repeat with each event, then try combinations of the top three possible point values for each event to find most optimal point value overall
