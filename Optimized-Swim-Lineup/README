Based on the number of points each place earns and the constraints on the number of events each swimmer can perform, there
is an optimized swim lineup that a swim coach can put together to earn the maximum number of points for the team.
Normally, a coach has to do this manually, but it can potentially be automated using data analysis.

A lot more work still needs to be put in. I would need a pdf reader to read and store best times that swimmers have 
compared to best times of the opposing team. I would also then need to be able to test an indefinite number of combinations
and find the best one. There are several limits to this approach, including accounting for injuries and illnesses,
allowing swimmers a gap event to rest, and including B and C relays.
