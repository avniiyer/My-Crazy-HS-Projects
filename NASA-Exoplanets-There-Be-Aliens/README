After extracting exoTest and exoTrain from the archive file (570 rows x 3198 columns) I used PCA dimensionality 
reduction to extract the two primary components contributing to Exoplanet prediction in order to plot the data. I then
used several classifiers and regression models to predict whether the planet is an exoplanet. 

1) Logistic Regression
A regression model, fit on X_pca and y_train, likely not suitable for complex data that does not fit a logisitic
relationship. 

2) Polynomial SVM classifier
Preprocessed using Standard Scaler. The model with the best hyperarameters are chosen from a grid search.
Fit on X_pca and y_train. Better for fitting to a polynomial, more complex relationship. 

3) Binary MLP classifier
The loss used is binary_crossentropy. A neural network is able to determine relationships in a blackbox.
