First, I read and store the content of each spam or ham email. I concatenate the two separate spam and ham email datasets
into one larger dataset. Using TfidfVectorizer, the frequency of key dictionary words are converted into a feature vector. Two 
major classifiers are then used to sort between spam or ham emails:

1) SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) Classifier
Using backpropogation, SGD updates linear coefficien weights to minimize the loss function. Three cross validation iterations
are used to avoid overfitting. 

2) Random forest classifier
Using cross validation prediction again, a random forest classifier is used to predict the probability of belonging
to the spam or ham class.
