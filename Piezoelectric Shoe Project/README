Piezoelectric components work through converting pressure to electrical signals. Using piezoelectric components, a multimeter, and a soldering kit, I put together a shoe inlaid
with a piezoelectric circuit. The goal was that walking should generate enough electrical charge to charge a phone.

Unfortunately, not enough charge was actually generated to be significant.
