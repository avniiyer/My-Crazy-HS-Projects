The goal of this work was to predict rsi, a value that has a threshold that shows when to buy or sell a share
of stock to maximize profit.

For each entry in a chronological timesheet of stock entries, there are 7 features: "t" (timestamp with data and time),
"h" (high, the highest value of the stock on that interval), "o" (the value at the stock at the opening of this interval)
"c" (the value of the stock at the closing of this interval), "l" (low, the lowest value of the stock on the interval),
"v" (volume of the stock), and "rsi" (reletave strength indicator of the stock)

After feature engineering and determining a correlation matrix, I determined that the difference between the 
"close" and "open" time is also a valueable feature as it correlates highly with yield strength, so I add this to the dataset.

Three main regression models are used to predict rsi. 

1) Linear Regression
A SimpleImputer pipeline processing is used to standardize data. Even when just correlating difference in open and close
values, the RSI can be predicted with an RMSE of 0.15899833548288914

2) Random Forest Regressor
10 Cross Validation iterations are used with the hyperparameters 
Hyperparameters: {'bootstrap': True, 'ccp_alpha': 0.0, 'criterion': 'squared_error', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features': 1.0,
                  'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'max_samples': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 
                  'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_weight_fraction_leaf': 0.0, 'n_estimators': 100, 'n_jobs': None, 
                  'oob_score': False, 'random_state': None, 'verbose': 0, 'warm_start': False}



3) Decision Tree Regressor
A grid search is used to determine the bes model of the Decision Tree Regressor. 
The best hyperparameters are shown to be:
Best Hyperparameters: {'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': 'log2', 'max_depth': None}

Using this final best model, which had the best results, I was able to print the predicted RSI values with a timestamp.
