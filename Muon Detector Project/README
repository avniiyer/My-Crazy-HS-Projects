Muons are fundamental particles part of the Standard Model of physics. They are leptons, part of the fermion class, and are essentially large, negatively charged particles.
They are found as radiation from nuclear waste and astrophysical sources. Atmospheric muons are also highly prevelant. 

A muon detector with a plastic scintillator works by detecting a cone of light muons emit when traveling faster than light in a medium (known as cherenkov radiation) and 
converting it to electric signals thanks to a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPm). 

CosmicWatch provides the framework for building a desktop muon detector:

Following this procedure, I began building the desktop muon detector.
